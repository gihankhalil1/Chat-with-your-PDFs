# Chat with Your PDFs ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Chat with Your PDFs** application! This project allows you to upload PDF files, extract their content, and have an interactive chat experience with the information in those PDFs. Leveraging Googleâ€™s Generative AI and FAISS for efficient document retrieval, this app provides a user-friendly way to interact with your documents.

---

## Features

- **Upload Multiple PDFs**: Upload one or more PDF files for processing.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from the uploaded PDFs for further analysis.
- **Embeddings with Google Generative AI**: Uses Google Generative AI to create embeddings for document retrieval.
- **Conversational AI**: Allows you to ask questions and have a conversation with the content of your PDFs.
- **Multilingual Support**: Automatically detects and responds in the language and tone of your input (formal, informal, or neutral).
- **Memory Integration**: Maintains context with a conversation buffer memory.
- **Custom Prompts**: Handles ambiguous or casual queries with clarity and politeness.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the application.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and clustering of embeddings.
- **LangChain**: For building conversational retrieval chains.
- **Google Generative AI**: Used for embedding creation and conversational LLMs.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-pdfs.git
   cd chat-with-pdfs
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Key**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the App**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**
   - Use the sidebar to upload one or more PDF documents.
   
2. **Processing**
   - The app extracts text from the uploaded PDFs and splits it into manageable chunks.
   - Embeddings are generated using Google Generative AI.
   - A FAISS vector store is created for efficient retrieval.

3. **Ask Questions**
   - Enter your questions or commands in the input box.
   - The app uses a conversational retrieval chain to provide relevant and contextual responses based on the content of your PDFs.

4. **Multilingual Responses**
   - The app detects the language and tone of your input and mirrors it in the response.
